## Advantages of the HuobiP2PBot bot in trading on the Huobi cryptocurrency exchange?
Huobi P2P exchange does not support API and we have created our own API Python SDK - which helps to redeem orders very quickly on Huobi cryptocurrency exchange

The bot is multitasking - it can perform several tasks at the same time (you can simultaneously buy orders for different cryptocurrencies)

The choice of currency (fiat) and payment methods (banks) in the bot is dynamic and pulled directly from the Huobi exchange - this makes it possible to buy cryptocurrency for any currency in any country

After launching the task (order) you created, the bot will monitor prices on the Huobi P2P exchange, and as soon as the price appears below the one set in the task you created, the bot will open a deal and notify you in a telegram
